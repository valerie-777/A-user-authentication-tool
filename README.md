Behavioral biometrics has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of traditional authentication methods. By leveraging the unique behavior patterns exhibited by individuals, such as keystroke and mouse use characteristics, commonly known as keystroke, mouse and touchscreen (KMT) dynamics, gait, or voice, behavioral biometrics offers a new dimension of authentication that enhances security and accuracy. (Yampolskiy & Govindaraju, 2008) 
The concept behind behavioral biometrics lies in the recognition and analysis of individual behavior patterns. This technology capitalizes on the fact that human behavior is inherently difficult to replicate or imitate, providing an additional layer of authentication that is challenging for malicious actors to bypass. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of behavioral biometrics and its applications in user authentication. 
This presents a software that uses keystroke dynamics to provide secure payment authentication, without compromising the user experience. The software captures user keystroke dynamics, whilst users enter card details on a payment form. Then, measurable patterns generated from the data processing unit are processed using a machine learning algorithm to generate a uniquely identifying model for the user. The model can be tested subsequently with KMT dynamics input from the same and/or other user(s) and authentication is either approved or denied.
